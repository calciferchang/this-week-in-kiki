      <h1>07</h1>
      <p>
        hello again, friday. it's been a busy week and it's hard to imagine that
        the week is "over" again. thing is, i don't think it's ever going to be
        less so and i don't know if i want it to be. i think in a way, being
        busy and overworked has forced me to overcome many aspects of my
        perfectionism. as of late, i simply don't have time to try and get
        everything perfect and it's pushed me to really identify what it is that
        i value and am trying to achieve and finding the best way to get there.
        being busy and especially writing this newsletter has made me more
        conscious of every minute, each means more, feels more precious. i don't
        have the time anymore to worry about whether or not something is good
        enough or not, whether i'm good enough or not, at some point, it just
        needs to be done.
      </p>

      <p>
        i've felt FOMO in the past on the things that i haven't managed to get
        done or haven't been satisfied with completing which being busy has
        really helped me with. i've been able to come to peace with the fact
        that i'm not going to be good enough sometimes but each time i'm
        learning more about what i'm not good at, which will eventually let me
        see improvement as i learn what i previously did not know. kind of
        related to my ramble from before.

          continuing to learn on image/text relationships. the main word i'm
          analyzing is "consumption". i'm not super happy on where i am with
          this so far, I feel as though it leans too deeply into a Luddite
          perspective that I'm not interested in exploring or arguing. i think
          what i want to get at is how media and capitalism pushes us to consume
          addictively while obfuscating its costs. capitalism tries to tie
          consumption to our identity so that consuming is a tenet of our
          existence. <br />

              my assignment is making me think more on what we consume and how
              and it's brought to mind how we've started just taking storage for
              granted with the invention of the cloud. when we upload things, we
              assume that it will still be there when we return. is it
              dissimilar from putting things in a gallery or a locker room?
              though their purpose is to keep them safe, can we really trust
              them to always be there?
            </li>
            <li>
              I tend to be very skeptical of cloud-based products, not out of
              worry for them losing data (<a

                >though that technically can happen</a
              >), but because there isn't really an incentive for them to keep
              it. Polyvore, a company founded in 2007, was intended to be a
              platform to facilitate online shopping, the idea being to provide
              users with a canvas to collect and put together outfits with
              images, earning Polyvore revenue through affiliate links from
              purchases. However, Polyvore found an audience entirely different
              from its intended one: "very young women who couldn't afford the
              designer clothes they were interested in." For them, "Polyvore
              offered a way of engaging with beautiful things for free. Fashion
              as a mode of expression goes far beyond what you wear or even what
              you wish you could afford to own." These are writings by an Are.na
              user by the name of Jill Blackmore, the curator of

                >The Polyvore Archive</a
              >, a channel that serves as an archive of Polyvore posts after
              it's sudden closure after being acquired by Ssense. Its closure
              was not widely discussed outside of posts and forums, something
              likely due to the marginalized nature of its users. The images in
              this archive were later discovered in datasets used for machine
              learning. It speaks as a warning that despite the milennial
              warnings that whatever goes on the internet will be on there
              forever, that only remains true until it ceases to hold value for
              those paying for its storage. We should not rely on corporations
              to have our best interests at heart (something noted in every
              Privacy Policy that can be updated without notice) and should not
              expect them to. If something is important to us, we should take
              action to preserve it, a mentality that can be applied to many
              things on this earth.

              Cost of storage— The cloud allows us to be ignorant of the cost of
              hoarding. Data centers in the US consume 9% of the annual power
              demand, projected to increase to 12% by 2030. More than half of
              this power is fueled by fossil fuels, not to mention the water
              costs which I frankly struggle to even visualize. <br /><a

              This is related to my thoughts on the importance of curation as by
              saving what is important to us, we will realize what is not,
              further allowing us to eliminate the need for storing everything
            </li>
            <li>
              I have some thoughts on the myth of "everything on the internet
              will be there forever." this is only true as long as people want
              to preserve something: movies, porn, video games, things that
              people want. If the main person who something is important to is
              you, you should probably save it.
