    <h1>intentional friction and the importance of curation</h1>

    <p>
      The dynamics of social media have been on my mind a lot recently. On one
      hand, it's really impressive to me from a technological standpoint: in the
      last thirty years, we've been able to be exposed to other people and other
      cultures in a way previously unthinkable. I have friends today and have
      had experiences that simply wouldn't have been possible twenty years ago.
      But on the other hand, it's caused irreparable harm and change to people.
      The amount we're connected to one another is what makes this such a
      problem: the human brain was never meant to process this amount of
      information. In the same way we cannot comprehend a billionaire's wealth,
      we cannot comprehend the amount of complicated human beings out there,
      which has caused the internet to become such a hostile place in the last
      ten years.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because we don't have the ability to comprehend the amount of people we
      are exposed to, we reduce them to stereotypes or archetypes in our mind.
      This is normal, just how our mind processes information, but when people
      aren't aware of this happening, it can result in really dangerous and
      harmful behavior.
    </p>

    <p>
      We're recreating something that's based on how we remember it but without
      thinking about why we left it behind
    </p>

    <p>
      Whenever I hear people reminiscing about how they miss MySpace or some
      relic of the early 2000s, I wonder what about it that they miss. After
      all, we innovated from that point for a reason. Things like SpaceHey try
      to recreate it but forget that the reason that we ended up with Instagram,
      Facebook, Twitter, is because there was something that MySpace lacked:
      discoverability, for one, which lead to the development of the algorithm
      which is so controversial today. The problem is that while we want to
      discover each other naturally, we are connected with others too much to
      feasibly do so on our own.
    </p>

    <p>
      The problem is that there are really only two ways to experience the
      internet right now: inundation, where we are bombarded with
      advertisements, sponsored posts, and then people trying to play up trends,
      or droughts when people can no longer bear drowning in that ecosystem. It
      feels like the internet is in this vicious cycle where things bubble up,
      hit this boiling point, and then fracture and break off. Twitter →
      Mastodon, Bluesky, Threads. TikTok → Reels, Shorts. The issue is, these
      things suffer from the same problem: when you go off of the main Bluesky
      thread, you join a Mastodon instance, it's a common experience to just not
      find many people there and to feel as though you're in a drought. We want
      to connect with others but it's not quite possible to do so in a way
      that's not overwhelming right now. It's the same way with news, so many
      people I know don't read it because doing so is stressful with the amount
      that's going on, especially now. The world is huge and there's things
      going on all over the place, it's hard to figure out a way to sift through
      it all. News outlets are starting to innovate, with things like
      <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters"
        >topic-focused newsletters (New York Times)</a
      >
      or
      <a href="https://bitesizebkk.co/"
        >more digestible, bite-sized news formats</a
      >.
    </p>

    <p>
      Part of the reason I think that AI has such a negative and visceral
      reaction against it is because it's exacerbating an existing issue, which
      is the amount of stuff that's not really worth paying attention to.
      Ragebait, satire, fake stories, misleading content, misinformation, all
      things that AI makes it so much easier to do. Something I have grown to
      believe more over time, and I think others too, is the need for curation
      in our own lives.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fifty years ago, the world was a lot more interesting because people were
      exposed to such little of it. People were forced to search for things they
      found interesting. Now, it's so easily available, which is both a blessing
      and a curse. We've never been more exposed to more and I think that we've
      been getting more docile as a result. I had a separate thought on this
      from a while ago, the idea that being bored is a good thing.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, I'm optimistic about this: I think in the long run, our standards
      will increase and our taste will evolve as a reaction to this inundation.
      Because there's so much, I think that this coming generation is going to
      learn to be better at learning what they value and what they want to spend
      time on. TikTok is relatively new, only about five years, and I think
      already people are realizing that they're not comfortable with how much
      time that they're spending on these apps. That while we have the ability
      to share and create each and every thing we find, that we maybe shouldn't,
      forcing us to think about what we value and are interested in and
      eventually, pushing everyone to become a curator.
