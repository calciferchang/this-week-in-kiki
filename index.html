        A lot of the struggles have been relating to getting stuff done. In the
        past, I've struggled with motivation but this week its been mostly
        attention and energy (or at least, moreso than usual<a
          href="#fn1"
          class="footnote-ref"
          >[1]</a
        >). i'm not sure if it's a result of the school semester starting and my
        brain trying to get used to it again or if this is simply another one of
        life's ebbs and flows. Whichever it is, it's had me thinking more on how
        i spend my time and energy in the face of the lack of it.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p>
        At its worst, my attention feels scattered and dispersed— try as I
        might, nothing is being processed. I think that I'm realizing that my
        energy can be compared to a single charge in a battery. Whatever the
        charge is at when the day begins, that's what I have to work with today
        and once it's empty, that's all I have until tomorrow. What I've been
        starting to find some success with is putting the highest effort,
        highest priority things first<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref">[2]</a>
        and checking in with myself throughout the day to make sure I'm not
        burning myself out.
      </p>

      <p>
        Being aware that I only really have so much energy in the day has made
        me think more on what I'm prioritizing with what I'm spending my energy
        on and really making me question what I value in my day-to-day. For
        example, shitposting on the internet can be amusing but really isn't
        fulfilling (and at times is detrimental to my social life) but it's
        really <em>easy</em> to do. This newsletter, on the other hand, is
        incredibly fulfilling but requires a lot of effort and commitment to
        even write and curate, let alone things like building a website or
        styling. This dynamic of things has been on my mind a lot recently, I
        feel like many things today have become rather shallow: intended to be
        easily accessible, consumable, and addictive but wholly unfulfilling.
        Fast food. Social media. Hollywood. Video games. To me, this is the
        value of curation— when everything in our life is vying for our
        attention, we gain the power to decide what we choose to do with it.

    <h2>on the mind</h2>

    <div>
      <p>
        Luddism has been on the mind recently with the rise of anti-AI
        sentiment. It's interesting how the sentiments from from a couple
        centuries ago with the beginning of industrialization became relevant
        again 10 years ago with the rise of big tech and are once again
        resurgent with the growth of AI. In doing research on the topic, I found
        <a
          href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/14/opinion/krugman-sympathy-for-the-luddites.html?_r=0"

          >alt link</a
        >). The author quotes the woolworkers of the 18th century— "'Who will
        maintain our families, whilst we undertake the arduous task' of learning
        a new trade? Also, they asked, what will happen if the new trade, in
        turn, gets devalued by further technological advance?"

        Today, almost 60% of bachelor's degree holders graduate in debt, each
        owing 30k on average. Housing prices have just about

          >doubled in the past 50 years (accounting for inflation)</a
        >
        with houses being
        <a
          href="https://www.longtermtrends.net/home-price-median-annual-income-ratio/"
          >more expensive than ever compared to household income</a
        >.

          >Cost of living has skyrocketed</a
        >
        while
        <a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/charting-wage-stagnation/"
          >pay has stagnated</a
        >. In the current political and economic landscape, it's simply not
        feasible nor reasonable to ask everyone displaced by structural
        unemployment to re-educate themselves and as a result the opposition to
        AI being so staunch is unsurprising: most people
        <em>cannot afford</em> to fail and to many, it represents another effort
        by the wealthiest to extract value from the 99%.

        Today, Luddism is remembered as a foolish endeavor to resist progress
        yet we see their arguments resurfacing in conversations on the legality
        and ethicality of AI, especially in the context of their relation to
        corporate cost-cutting. However, as the Luddites' failure has proven to
        us, progress <em>is</em> inevitable and structural unemployment an
        unfortunate consequence of it. With this acknowledgment, I agree with
        Krugman that the only solution is "having a strong social safety net,
        one that guarantees not just health care but a minimum income, too."
        While this support system is bemoaned by many in my country, I wonder
        what their substitute would be given how compared to last year

        I just finished my first week of classes, which has substantially
        increased my mental overhead. (i attribute the delay of this to the
        increase in work alongside writing taking significantly longer that i

        One of my first projects is on exploring relationships between images
        and text. The structure of the deliverable is simple, three 8.5x11 with
        a 7x7 image and one word in 30pt Helvetica Light. However, the
        simplicity is my favorite part of the project and I've has a lot of fun
        exploring the different ways I can manipulate the perception of the
        text.
