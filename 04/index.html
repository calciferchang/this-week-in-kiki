    <h1>This Week in Kiki 04</h1>
    <p>
      So, we're 2 for 4 on late posts. It's been an alright week, I've been
      struggling with my mental health a bit as of late. I struggle a lot with
      working myself too hard to the point where it's counterproductive to
      actually getting things done so I've been learning to take breaks, both
      for my eyes, body, and mind.
    </p>

    <p>
      This week feels like it's been an in-between week in anticipation of
      classes starting. Last year, I struggled with balancing my workload
      between classes quite a bit— something I wanted to take this summer to
      work on. I wanted to see if I could work on my own projects based solely
      on internal motivation and it was pretty challenging. I've been trying to
      develop some organizational skills and workflows to help me with this.
    </p>

    <p>
      I think the main thing that came out of this summer was this newsletter.
      I've had a lot of ideas of things that I would want to do but this is
      really the only thing that I think has been borne out of it of any
      meaningful way. I think the reason for that is all the other things i was
      trying to do were focused more "what if this was a thing" and then trying
      to figure out how to get there, only to find that my fundamentals were
      insufficient, which then killed all the momentum and motivation that i had
      for the project.
    </p>

    <p>
      On an off day this week, I rearranged my room (for the nth time) and moved
      my desk to have a better view of the window and I've found that I look
      outside much more now.

    <p>
      I've been thinking a lot about how I'm perceived by others and it's been
      hurting my brain. I don't tend to think about how other people think of me
      but I take note about how they perceive me, as contradictory as it sounds.
      I think about the things that they tell me, how they refer to me or think
      about what I say and do, which I benchmark against my own perception of
      myself but I don't really dedicate thought to "what if's." I've been
      thinking about how I perceive myself, how I want to perceive myself and if
      that's different than how I currently do, how I want others to perceive
      me, how I think others perceive me, and how I adjust my behavior to bring
      how I think others perceive me closer to what I want them to perceive me
      as.
    </p>

    <p>
      There's a quote that's stuck with me (that I can't figure out the source
      of for the life of me)— "I am not who I think I am. I am not who you think
      I am. I am who I think that you think I am." I am not who I am because I
      live my life constantly surrounded by myself, overexposed to my flaws and
      sometimes blind to my strengths. I am not who others think I am because
      they are exposed to only certain sides of me, which is biased to their
      individual interests and what sides of me they are interested in
      exploring. However, I am conscious of how others perceive me in my
      interactions with them in those spaces and try to adjust my behavior in
      those situations to be the kind of person that I want to be which, in the
      end, is the most accurate depiction of the kind of person that I am.

    <p>
      I think we over-value "human touch." Humans do not innately have something
      in them that makes something good or well-done in the same way that AI
      does not change our standards of what is "good" or "beautiful." I'm
      frustrated by how so many arguments against generative AI is how it lacks
      "the human touch", as though if we allow the technology to exist, it will
      turn all that should be creative into a homogenized visual corporate
      noise. First of all, we've already been there, around 75 years ago.

    <p>
      One of the main critiques of the Swiss Style/International Style is that
      it was too samey. Initially, it was revolutionary for its univers(al)
      neutral aesthetic that could be applied to nearly anything. However, it
      became tiresome for the same reason— to the common person, everything
      looked identical, overly function and restrained from the grid, leading to
      an explosion of new forms of expression in New Wave, Punk, and
      Postmodernist design. (see: Wolfgang Weingart, David Carson, and Paula
      Scher)
    </p>

    <p>
      AI does not change what we find interesting, beautiful, or eye-catching.
      Its creations are uncanny, dishonest, shallow imitations of reality that
      mimic appearance without understanding meaning and culture. These were the
      same failings of the Swiss Style— in attempting to appeal to everyone, it
      lacked a human personality. However, future designers used the structure
      of the Swiss Style to break away and subvert it; most modern aesthetics
      share some heritage with it and it's even seeing a resurgence with the web
      and CSS Grids (hello, brutalism).

        The AI is made to imitate, to produce the worst type of inauthenticity:
        inauthenticity which seeks profit from its claim to be authentic while
        taking itself deadly seriously.

      However, the AI only knows how to copy what it has been fed. The fault
      lies not within the machine that does (or should we be suing school
      scanners and printers for piracy?) but the culture that rewards such
      behavior. In the end, the robot is only copying what we humans are already
      doing for hundreds of years as we copy and remix and remake until what the
      original's meaning is lost, its appearance only a reference at a glance,
      copying for copying's sake.

      I'm still exploring what I want this series to be. I'm really interested
      in having more conversations on personal use of AI, whether for work or in
      creative practices. I enjoy using it as a medium to share what's been at
      the forefront of my mind.
