    <h1>this week in kiki, 05</h1>

        >Congress can say that two years can constitute one calendar day</a
      >
      then I can say that last week's newsletter is releasing on a Tuesday. It's
      been a messy week, but in a way that I'm very thankful for. School just
      began last week and it's been demanding, even though it was expected.
    </p>

    <blockquote>

    <p>
      A lot of the struggles have been relating to getting stuff done. In the
      past, I've struggled with motivation but this week its been mostly
      attention and energy (or at least, moreso than usual<sup>[1]</sup>). I'm
      not sure if it's a result of the school semester starting and my brain
      trying to get used to it again or if this is simply another one of life's
      ebbs and flows. Whichever it is, it's had me thinking more on how i spend
      my time and energy in the face of the lack of it.

    <p>
      At its worst, my attention feels scattered and dispersed— try as I might,
      nothing is being processed. I think that I'm realizing that my energy can
      be compared to a single charge in a battery. Whatever the charge is at
      when the day begins, that's what I have to work with today and once it's
      empty, that's all I have until tomorrow. What I've been starting to find
      some success with is putting the highest effort, highest priority things
      first<sup>[2]</sup>
      and checking in with myself throughout the day to make sure I'm not
      burning myself out.

      biggest one first.
      <br />— Mark Twain
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Being aware that I only really have so much energy in the day has made me
      think more on what I'm prioritizing with what I'm spending my energy on
      and really making me question what I value in my day-to-day. For example,
      shitposting on the internet can be amusing but really isn't fulfilling
      (and at times is detrimental to my social life) but it's really
      <em>easy</em> to do. This newsletter, on the other hand, is incredibly
      fulfilling but requires a lot of effort and commitment to even write and
      curate, let alone things like building a website or styling. This dynamic
      of things has been on my mind a lot recently, I feel like many things
      today have become rather shallow: intended to be easily accessible,
      consumable, and addictive but wholly unfulfilling. Fast food. Social
      media. Hollywood. Video games. To me, this is the value of curation— when
      everything in our life is vying for our attention, we gain the power to
      decide what we choose to do with it.

    <h2>on the mind</h2>

    <p>
      I've been thinking about Luddism<sup>[3]</sup> with the rise of anti-AI
      sentiment. It's interesting how the sentiments from from a couple
      centuries ago with the beginning of industrialization became relevant
      again 10 years ago with the rise of big tech and are once again resurgent
      with the growth of AI. In doing research on the topic, I found
      <a
        href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/14/opinion/krugman-sympathy-for-the-luddites.html?_r=0"
        >this article from 2013 that feels once again relevant</a
      >
      (<a

        >alt link</a
      >). The author quotes the woolworkers of the 18th century— "'Who will
      maintain our families, whilst we undertake the arduous task' of learning a
      new trade? Also, they asked, what will happen if the new trade, in turn,
      gets devalued by further technological advance?"
    </p>
    <blockquote class="footnote" id="fn3">
      Luddites were members of a 19th-century movement of English textile
      workers who opposed the use of certain types of automated machinery due to
      concerns relating to worker pay and output quality, destroying machines in
      organised raids as a form of protest.

      Today, almost 60% of bachelor's degree holders graduate in debt, each
      owing 30k on average. Housing prices have just about
      <a href="https://www.longtermtrends.net/home-price-vs-inflation/"
        >doubled in the past 50 years (accounting for inflation)</a
      >
      with houses being
      <a
        href="https://www.longtermtrends.net/home-price-median-annual-income-ratio/"
        >more expensive than ever compared to household income</a
      >.
      <a href="https://www.in2013dollars.com/us/inflation/1977"
        >Cost of living has skyrocketed</a

      while
      <a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/charting-wage-stagnation/"
        >pay has stagnated</a
      >. In the current political and economic landscape, it's simply not
      feasible nor reasonable to ask everyone displaced by structural
      unemployment to re-educate themselves and as a result the opposition to AI
      being so staunch is unsurprising: most people <em>cannot afford</em> to
      fail and to many, it represents another effort by the wealthiest to
      extract value from the 99%.
    </p>

    <p>
      Today, Luddism is remembered as a foolish endeavor to resist progress yet
      we see their arguments resurfacing in conversations on the legality and
      ethicality of AI, especially in the context of their relation to corporate
      cost-cutting. However, as the Luddites' failure has proven to us, progress
      <em>is</em> inevitable and structural unemployment an unfortunate
      consequence of it. With this acknowledgment, I agree with Krugman that the
      only solution is "having a strong social safety net, one that guarantees
      not just health care but a minimum income, too."

      While this kind of support system is bemoaned by many in my country, I

    <h2>what i'm doing.</h2>

    <p>
      I just finished my first week of classes, which has substantially
      increased my mental overhead. (i attribute the delay of this to the
      increase in work alongside writing taking significantly longer that i
      anticipated)

      One of my first projects is on exploring relationships between images and
      text. The structure of the deliverable is simple, three 8.5x11 with a 7x7
      image and one word in 30pt Helvetica Light. However, the simplicity is my
      favorite part of the project and I've has a lot of fun exploring the
      different ways I can manipulate the perception of the text.
